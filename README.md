# üõ∞Ô∏è Bypassing Proxy Connection Issues with a Custom Upstream Proxy

This project provides a **lightweight Python-based upstream proxy** to help penetration testers route traffic through **Burp Suite** (or any local proxy) even when an application or browser **fails to connect directly through Burp**.  

Instead of relying on heavy tools, this script acts as an **intermediary forwarder**, passing all HTTP/HTTPS requests to your local Burp proxy allowing smooth interception without connection errors.

Requires python 3.8+, Works on both windows and linux

## ‚ö° How It Works

**Internet <--> Python Upstream Proxy <--> Burp Suite <--> Browser / Mobile App**

- Browser/App connects sent the traffic to proxy(burp).
- Upstream proxy host:port of this python script is configured in burp, The Python proxy transparently forwards traffic to/from Burp running on 127.0.0.1:8080.
- Burp captures and analyzes the traffic as usual.

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.8+ installed.
- `pip install httpx`
- Burp Suite running locally (default port 8080)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

```bash
usage: Bypass_proxy.py [-h] [-p PORT] [-b BIND] [-v] [--allow ALLOW]

Upstream proxy that handles modern TLS/HTTP2 to origin

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -p, --port PORT  Port to listen on (default: 8081)
  -b, --bind BIND  Bind address (default: 127.0.0.1)
  -v, --verbose    Verbose logging
  --allow ALLOW    Allowlist host[:port] (can repeat). If empty, all hosts allowed.
```

## ‚ö° BurpSuite configuration

- Make sure burpsuite is running on any port.
- Make sure this proxy script is also running
- Go to **BurpSuite proxy settings** --> **Network** --> **Upstream proxy server** --> add the proxy details of this script.

  For-example: **destination host**= *, **proxy host**=127.0.0.1, **proxy port**=8081 --> **OK** --> Make sure the checkbox is on/checked
